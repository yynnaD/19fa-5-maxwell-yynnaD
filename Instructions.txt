Maxwell's Demon
Instructions

How to play:
You will need all 3 files in the repository to play:
	- MaxDemon.java
	- GamePanel.java
	- Particle.java
	
To start the game run MaxDemon which will pull up the game GUI. 
The buttons perform the task defined on the button.
Press anywhere on the game screen to open the door,
and release to close it. 

Enjoy!


*Other Notes*
There is a comment in the move() method of Particle.java that
I forgot to remove during debugging. It can be ignored.
